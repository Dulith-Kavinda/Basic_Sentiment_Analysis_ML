"There isn't too much in the way of suspense or surprises when it comes to the story, but there are some shocking moments and funny lines in this epic finale. Again, like many of the best Marvel films, the holes and flaws are covered up with humor and fan service, making everything okay. That being said, I did prefer Infinity War to this film, which really misses the leads of the other Marvel franchises that were ""snapped"" out. Overall, however, there are only a few ways you can wrap up the main story of the MCU, and this was a solid direction.",1
"I cried and laughed and blah, blah, blah. CGI was great, but I can't get past all the subtext to create plot rules and then completley blow them put of the water. I can think of about 5 minutes of scenes and a slightly different way to handle the last moments of the battle that would have covered those holes. I can't believe no one said ""Hang on a minute. This wont work.""",1
Not as good as infinity war..,1
"First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.I laughed, lots.
I cried, lots.
I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots
I even punched the air in a ""go on!"" during one sceneI can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.Go with it. Enjoy the ride.Soak up every second, it doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.I have nothing else to say.10/10. Well done Russo brothers. Well done!Fans! Assemble!",1
"This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.",1
"Thank you Marvel, End Game is an ending that give me speechless.",1
"After watching Infinity war, I was looking forward to much more this time, still a perfect ending.",1
As always avengers didn't disappoint even with a few loops or inconsistencies. Hope marvel does more movies about some characters from avengers.,1
"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie.",1
"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10",1
LOOK AT FAT BUMBLING THOR AND LAUGH and ignore the plot holes pls,0
"I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).If ""Return of the King"" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.Go see it.",1
"Indulgent rubbish. Do yourself a favor and just watch infinity war because this film is boring and by the end, I just did not care anymore!",1
Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.,1
"Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!",1
"I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies.
I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!",1
Not as good as infinity war but a great movie,1
Emotional but bit messy.,1
Should have ended on infinity war,0
"The Russo Brothers will be forever known as the directors that failed a franchise and insulted the very fans that embraced it.I have no idea why they felt their finished product would pay homage to Stan Lee's legacy or the characters he brought to life but this ""closure"" to a decade of greatness was, in fact, the most disappointing 3-hours of character assassination in cinematic history.",1
"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but would I watch it a second time? Probably not - until the DVD comes out.I've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.That being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.It's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.The fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.All in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me.",1
This movie proves the Russo brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to closing a franchise this big. In my opinion they pulled of the most satisfying ending this story arc could have.It's nothing without its previous 21 movies. Must watch for every movie fan.,1
"Rating 10/10
Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie. Go see it you wont regret it !! Perfection Marvel Endgame !!",1
"I loved how the story of the Infinity War was conceived. With all the fight scenes and the emotional aspect of the movie, especially the end part, everything was superb. But this is supposed to be a wrap-up film. The directors and writers just destroyed it all. What's the point of doing a hype over Captain Marvel for this movie when you just give her a few minutes of screen time? It would be forgiven if you give her an amazing fight with the villain during the climax. But what have you done? With just a few kicks and punches and that's it. It doesn't give a scratch over Thano's face. What a crap!!!You also ruin Hulk! He is supposed to be the strongest Avenger after the events of Infinity War, after all the disappointment and frustration he has experienced when Hulk won't face Thanos. But this time, he's just as good as nothing Avenger. I wonder why they did not give Thanos and Hulk a fight of a lifetime. I'm really surprised that they did not even get face-to-face when all hell breaks loose.This movie is dubbed as an action movie but got 75% of the time talking and mumbling.There's no justice at all to those beloved characters and this movie. You have ruined my expectations.",1
EndLame is disappointing and messy,0
"Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point.
In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements...
The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on.
Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out.",1
Great,1
I went in with the highest expectations and came out underwhelmed and disappointed. its nowhere near as good as infinity war !!!,1
"3 hours out of my life I will never get back.
not worth the hype. you think the soap opera is done by the ultimate battle.
think again. let us milk it and release another spider man. geez a lou.",1
"The dumbing down of Hulk and ruining his character by turning him into an utter wimp, turning Thor into a bumbling drunkard, really? Well done Disney on ruining yet another couple of hero's characters (See Luke Skywalker and Yoda in Disney's Last Jedi for extra confirmation of this) That's all I've got to say about this movie.",1
Mildly Overrated,1
Really Marvel??? Poor Poor Movie To End On!!,1
No,0
Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...,1
"This movie feels more like a culmination of all the Marvel movies. A perfect closing to the MCU uptil that point. It brings back all the major characters and settings throughout the whole Marvel franchise. Talking about the movie after almost 5 years even today I get goosebumps. It marks the end of a few main characters that will literally drive any Marvel fan to tears. The plot revisits a few great Marvel moments from earlier movies literally bringing in a wave of nostalgia. The film has remarkable action, splendid visual effect, moving musical score and an even greater emotional weight. Kudos to the actors, directors, writers and the whole team for making such an awesome movie that has left a profound impact on our generation. This movie will always remain special to me.",1
The Most Overrated Movie Of All Time. (Will Always be the Most Overrated and most Forgettable Movie Of all Time.),1
Absolutely strange how they could cut so strong first part of Avengers and spoil the second one! All dialogues are weak and absurd same as a few plot lines. The last 5 minutes of the film is all-around failure!,1
"Basically the title. Left me speechless. I was probably too hyped to the point of annoyance but it broke my massive expectations to the point that I'm watching it again 2 more times this weekend. It leaves you at the edge of your seat and the 3rd act is just insane and a masterpiece. Infinity War was fantastic but this is insanity, in all the right ways. The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some.",1

"Wow... All i can say is that the movie ended my entire childhood in the most perfect way!!
It kept you on your feet the whole way through!! Marvel somehow manages to add comedy to the most intense situations. its Awesome!! The battle scene was out of this world!! I just... wow.. Thank you marvel. I love you 3000!!!
ROBERT DOWN JUNIOR WON THE HERO OF THE YEAR AWARD THIS YEAR LAST WEEK AT THE MTV MOVIE AND TV AWARDS!!",1
"It's a long film at 3 hours the last one being better because this concludes the 10 year story in at great and satisfying way. The first 2 hours are build up that is ultimately paid off but I felt the middle dragged on I just wanted to get to the end. Infinity war kept me interested the whole time, more than endgame. It's definitely worth the whatch and after you don't have to worry about spoilers.8/10.",1
Not better than Infinity War,1
"THE STORY IS VERY WELL BUILT
THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CHARACTERS IS GREATCGI IS GOODTHE PERFORMANCE IS GOODIT WAS A GREAT LAST CHAPTER AFTER THIS FILMuDIDN'T WATCH ANYTHING ABOUT MARVEL BECAUSE NOW IT JUST MAKES GARBAGE.",1
"Don't listen to the haters, it's amazing! Seriously, this is the movie of the year!",1
One of the best superhero movies I have ever watched.All the actors really nailed their roles.Especially my one and only favorite iron man.Robert Downey Jr is irreplaceable in Iron man role.,1
Epic movie but no where near 10/10,1
"This is my own opinion, but so many things that didn't make sense in that movie... like so much stuff that could've been utilised in a better way and so many stupid things that were put on wrong hands. The image and the graphics are really good but the plot is weak.
Emotionally I give a 9/10
Graphics I give a 9/10
Storyline I give a 3/10",1
Really?,0
Best End of an era,1
They've really scrapped the bottom with this one! Oh so Bad!,1
Some good things but overall disappointing,1
Stupid ending ruined it all,1
"The best marvel movie ever, I cannot put into words how amazing this movie was, too good!",1
Great climax!,1
"It's funny to remember the reviews from 6 years ago in which someone talked about such a thing as a fan service. You see, going through some key events, meeting old versions/characters is a fanservice.Where are these commentators now, when literally all of Marvel's +-watchable projects are filled with fanservice? The rest are just bad and uninteresting.I don't understand any complaints. All the characters reach their peak of development and do the things they need for themselves. And the main villain manages to lose 2 times in 3 hours.Although repeated viewings do not give the same sensations as during the cinema premiere, I have a good memory, so I don't see any point in underestimating after a while. Few films can personally give me emotions of the same level. Maybe there won't be any more of them...",1
"Just ok,but youre a sheep if you believe its the best",1
3 stars for effort,0
"Avengers: Endgame is the final film to the Infinity saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story is emotional, unpredictable, unforgettable, complex and intense. The story does continue on right after infinity war had finsihed, and I thought it was a good way too start because the characters can give you an understanding of how they are feeling. How much loss they have witnessed.
During the three hour film, you care so much for the characters that it makes you want them to live through the whole time, leaving with no casualties. The acting by the cast is outstanding, none of their lines sounded cheesy. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr especially. The audience has never seen the two characters shine so bright and powerful over the last 11 years. The visuals are the most impressive, it is shown to be Oscar worthy and you would be hungry for more as the film continues on. The final battle was the bomb, the mother of all battles, better then Ready Player One's finale. It's so big and all of it fits in perfectly. Avengers Endgame is the perfect finale that has been set up over the last 11 years. Its a rewatchable film and you will never see the characters the same way as you have seen them from the past films.",1
Just watch this epic final of the best Marvel movie ever!,1
I was super excited to see this movie after Infinity War ended but I left rather disappointed. It was good but I felt like the first hour or so was wasted space. I did love Thor though.,1
"No words...absolutely incredible, THE best way to end the whole series. Watching all the movies to finish with this, every single hour was worth it, hats off to Marvel 👏🏽",1
"Despite what others may say or have said this film was far from predictable. I certainly lost my bets. I both laughed and cried during this film.
I loved every minute and none of those minutes were wasted. The writers outdid themselves on this one. I just hope the next ten years can live up to the first.
Here's hoping.",1
Just watched the new Avengers-movie. It's simply fantastic and a must-watch for every Marvel-Fan. It contains everything I expected and wished for an so much more. It's hard to put in words without a spoiler. Find out by yourself and enjoy.,1
Infinity war is head and shoulders above Endgame,1
"I just watched the Avengers movies and some of the infinity saga and I truly think this is a great movie, the CGI and acting were wonderful and the ending was truly a masterpiece and was probably the best ending for a movie saga (don't quote me on this). There are some low points but they are they don't effect the true rating which is a ten, this movie deservers the 8.4. Or an 8.5, I kinda have a bias. Cause i grew up with the marvel movies specifically Iron Man and stuff but the bias does not effect my rating. I live it and many others love it as well i regard this the end 0of the entire mcu from Iron Man - No Way Home, the other multiverse movies are mid and are very odd.",1
"No, no, and no again.",1
great performancesincredible visualsstory ends in a way to set worth a new generation of marvel stories/charactersperfect send off for the original actorsa must see for any marvel or superhero fan,1
Avengers: Endgame is simply the most marvelous superhero film ever made.,1
Avengers endgame,1
"""Avengers: Endgame"" - A Spectacular Culmination of Marvel's Cinematic UniverseEndgame is more than just a movie - it's the big, emotional payoff we'd been waiting for after over a decade of Marvel stories. From the very start, it hits you with the weight of what happened in Infinity War, but instead of rushing to the action, it takes its time, letting you feel everything.Every character gets their moment to shine. Tony Stark's journey comes full circle in a way that's heartbreaking and perfect. Steve Rogers? His ending feels like a warm hug to everyone who followed his story from day one. And the final battle... it's pure goosebumps. Every hero you've ever cheered for charging into the fight - it's impossible not to yell at the screen.The Russo brothers nailed the balance between epic action, gut-punch emotions, and those little bits of Marvel humor that make it all feel real. The soundtrack soars, the visuals are mind-blowing, and the crowd-pleasing moments are unforgettable.It's not just fan service - it's the ultimate thank-you letter to the fans. Endgame doesn't just wrap up the Infinity Saga, it sends it off in the most satisfying, tear-jerking, fist-pumping way possible.Verdict: A perfect finale. You'll laugh, cry, and probably rewatch it immediately.",1
"Let me start by saying THIS is how you wrap a saga!!!!
I loved this movie, it was an emotional rollercoaster from open to close, and a fitting way to pay tribute to the legend of Stan Lee.",1
"The climax that all fans deserve. Marvel still pulls out surprises that you couldn't dream of, allowing this to earn a spot anongst some of the greatest films made. The length yields an utterly satisfying scene, but honours the 11 years of the studio with the perfect ending.",1
"This was a fun movie, but it was by means no where near a 10/10. Infinity War was a much better movie to be honest. It had way better action and a better story. End Game's plot was a mess. Overall, it was an entertaining and fitting end to an era, but was by no means perfect.",1
"I watch all films with an open mind and went into this 3 hour long film without any preconceptions.This film really let itself down. The writers completely changed some of the characters, they tried to make it funny and failed at every attempt where it was cringe worthy and boring. The story was dragged out to its limit and went on for way to long.Don't waste your money at the cinema, maybe Google the outcome.",0
"Okay so Avengers- Endgame is the grand finale of the Marvel saga and, not gonna lie, it hits hard. Like, it's three hours long but somehow still feels like a sprint through your entire emotional range. Sad. Epic. Kinda hilarious. Then sad again. Then Captain America does something that made everyone in my theater scream like they just saw God. The plot? The Avengers are all depressed after Thanos did his big ""Snap"" thing and wiped out half of everything. So they go on a time-travel mission that's like a Marvel highlight reel on steroids. If you've seen the other movies, it's peak nostalgia. If you haven't, good luck understanding anything. Robert Downey Jr. And Chris Evans carried the emotional weight of the universe. Tony's arc? Brutal. Cap's ending? Chef's kiss. Also, the final battle? Bonkers. Like, every single Marvel character shows up and it's chaos in the best possible way. It made a bajillion dollars, broke every record ever, and people still talk about it like it's the Super Bowl of movies. It kind of was. Would recommend - just, maybe watch the other 21 movies first or you'll be very confused and also dead inside.",1
Not satisfied with Time Travel logic.,1
"I'm a huge fan of long slow-crawl movies (cue LOTR trilogy) but the first half of this culminating slog was way too slow and artificially melodramatic. This is in stark contrast to Infinity War's well edited, if not somewhat fractured fast paced scenes.If anything Infinity War could of used an extra 20min of dialogue and slower pacing edited out of Endgame. In the end, still a fun movie but not without obvious pacing flaws.",1
The Best end that avengers could have,1
I don't really know what all the hype is about. Bored watching this as it's the same again just rehashed. Glad to see the back of the Avengers to be honest.,1
"Endgame is certainly one of its kind. A movie that will be marked as the film of this decade. Building up from Iron Man to Captain Marvel, a 10 journey filled with joy, adventure and tears. And we need a perfect ending to all of that. Endgame is the perfect ending. A movie that has everything a fan will ever dream of, an amazing cast and a wonderful climax. It is such a huge payoff from 10 years worth of building up. To look at this from a Fan's perspective, it is an awesome movie and it is a masterpiece. But to look at this from a critic's perspective, it is not the best movie. It certainly lacks some elements to a perfect movie. But this to me, is such a wonderful movie and I definitely loved it. It has everything I wanted and I'm gonna give this movie a 9/10.",1
That's not fair to Thor,1
Very Disappointed,0
"Loved Endgame but with a lukewarm feeling for The Eternals and Shang Chi on the horizon, I wondered whether the MCU should make more logical choices for the next phase. Obviously there are development issues with the FF and X-Men franchises and DC's Aquaman may well scupper a potential Sub-Mariner movie, but perhaps these would work:1) Captain Britain (we heard 'Braddock' mentioned by Peggy Carter in Endgame; Brian's father perhaps?)
2) Alpha Flight. With the Avengers having run their course, perhaps their Canadian counterparts could step up. It stands to reason that other countries would want to copy the Avengers model (I know they are the Earth's protectors but they pretty much belong to the USA).
3) Moon Knight. Although I would love to see Daredevil done right on the big screen, maybe Marc Spector could fill the void.
4) Silver Surfer. Norrin Radd was the best thing about the FF sequel. A space-based movie would give him room to soar. Look to GotG or the Ron Lim Thanos issues of Silver Surfer for inspiration.
5) Ka-Zar. Although often perceived as a Tarzan rip-off, Lord Kevin Plunder's exploits could open up a whole new playground with the Savage Land.I wonder if we'll look back in 10 years and see if any of these came to pass...!",1
There are so many ways that the movie could have gone. But it is chosen to be this way. So the climax should not be criticised. The story is completed with no proper explanation for the rest of the avengers. Other avengers are not given importance in most of the places. Don't go to the movie if you know the spoilers. My experience has been spoiled by my friends.,1
Epic but left me several questions,1
A few issues but not bad at all!,1
Absolute peak of MCU,1
Could have been better!! If you compare it to IW doesn't hold a candle to it!!,1
"I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess.",1
If it wouldnt be SO ridiculous at some points...,1
"...and pull the hype train over.
Amazing fun, stunning spectacle great performances especially RDJ.
It's just not the whole sum of its parts.
Lots of great parts but not cohesively held.
Too much Comedy with one character essentially now just full comedy relief.
The most ridiculous coincidences and a couple of plot holes.
You will laugh, you will get gut punched and for some you will cry, but then you will wonder what really happened in that 3 hours.
Did it need 3 hours? No.
Is it better than infinity war? No.
Will you enjoy it? Definitely.",1
"For film industry's sake, stop comparing it with 'The Dark Knight' (2008)",0
Not a good film. Took me a few watches to realize.,1
"Let's talk about the enormity of this film and what Marvel just accomplished.First, this movie did not disappoint. It is very hard to contemplate a movie that will ever have as much or more anticipation than Endgame. Just think about the build up of this film. From May 2008 to April 2019, Marvel, in 21 films, introduced heroes, villains, plots, side plots, family members, love interests and countless Easter eggs that culminated into this film.Second, in a movie full with 10+ main characters, Marvel did an unbelievable job featuring each one and staying true to the characters we've all fallen in love with. This point could easily be a thesis paper for a doctoral candidate. The development and story arcs of characters, individually and collectively, in the midst of struggle and triumph is nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail and thoughtful craftsmanship is true artwork. One knock fans may have is the forced fandom moments. We have so many beloved characters but these moments comes as certain team-up pairings during the big fight that are great but also forced and stereotypical.Lastly, this movie is beauty in motion. Mainly, the movie looks and sounds wonderful. If there is one knock against the movie, the final fight at points was too dark for some of the characters. Otherwise, the final fight displays exactly what many of the DC movies have failed with, Hero power display. Marvel did such a great job of making you feel every punch, kick, hammer throw but also made you feel like you were in motion with each character (thus why I believe 4D would be very good). The sound editing is very good and the song selections in this movie help the viewers follow the emotional roller-coaster ride everyone believes they are in for.Marvel created near perfection for fans (or a near perfect ending). And the ending of this movie, isn't even technically the finish to Phase 3 of their universe. That would be Spider-man: Homecoming coming soon. Phase 4 and 5 are also already in the works. Everyone that was a part of this movie and the first 3 phases should be applauded, but their work is not yet done because for those with the greatest power comes great responsibility.",1
"⭐ 10/10 RDJ u r awesome. Great performance by director, cinematographer. Actions is excellent. Dialogues are extremely good.",1
"The first 50 minutes set up the movie very well but the second act lacks urgency and focus. The movie comes to a halt and feels as if it's meandering between scenes, not knowing what to do and not being very entertaining. The movie is also highly predictable and somewhat ruins Thanos's character due to a strange character decision. Iron man is given a lot to work with, which is compelling, same with Hawkeye. The ending is somewhat satisfying but also cringe. Overall it is a fine movie, not offensively bad but certainly not as good as it's predecessor.",1
"This movie past over and beyond any expectation. Don't miss watching it..... will definitely watch it again and again. ""Endgame"" The name fits perfectly.
Total respect",1
"It's every marvel fans dream come to reality, people can nip pick the time travel but that's not really a flaw because they done it right by giving the fans what they want, the movie has lot of fan services but it never hurts the plot it actually helps it and it shows how much the russo brothers cared about this universe, by time the movie ends you feel like a life time has past, the end of an era.",1
This film was hyped so much i couldn't wait to watch it....the film is good but i didnt get the wow factor i had when i watched infinity war.....all the trailers and the online leaks wasted the ending for me....i still love marvel movies and will go see every one that comes out but for me this was good but not as good as I/W,1

This movie has the absolute perfect balance of fan service and harsh moments. Lean into the tears and suspend a little disbelief. This movie is everything we needed and more than we deserved.,1
"Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to ""finish"" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: the character ""powers"" are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other scenes within a given story). That they sometimes ""reduce"" their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, but it's still something that takes me out of the story.What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, I think that's a pretty high compliment.",1
I didn't like the acting. Thanos doesn't seem like the badass of the first movie,1
"Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation.",1
The MCU should've ended here,1
Great movie i almost cried and great ending to the series of movies,1
"Nothing really happening ....Captain Marvel is in it for a bit...Black Panther was in it too, not sure whyDramatic scenes purely over the top....just seems like they tried to fit all 5000 Avengers into this film and actually forgot about the film3 hours, I'll never get back .......one good battle scene tho",0
Avengers endgame is one of a kind well done Marvel studios,1
"It's definitely not as strong an impression as it was on first viewing, which makes perfect sense, but I still think the film was extremely successful on multiple levels. One of the better things is that the three-hour film is not boring at any point, it seemed to me to last ""only"" two hours, which is not easy to achieve. I also look at this film as the finale or the last episode of a series you've been watching for years, which on the one hand is actually true. So much has happened before this film, so many characters and events. This film is just the crown of it all, one big rounded whole. It is obvious that the Russo brothers had a plan because it is obvious that they paid attention to details and some smaller moments that real fans will easily recognize. Of course I have some objections that are related to certain characters and some scenes, but given the type of film and how much the film offers, I can just get over it and forget about it. I think this Marvel project is unrepeatable and it's something we should appreciate no matter what you think of movies like this.",1
"A nice conclusion to the saga, it'll give you nerd chills",1
i used to cry after infinite war after endgame hmm not rly.,1
Son born in Iron Man year 2008....this is our inspiration,1
"The culmination of the infinity saga,this movie is going down in history as one of its kind. MIND-BLOWING MASTERPIECE.Words can't describe the grandiosity of this film. Worth watching more than once.",1
"The Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to a point where a film feels like an actual event. We have been waiting in anticipation for a year to see the final showdown that started in Infinity War. Actually, scratch that. The entire Infinity Saga started way back with Iron Man. 22 films, countless number of heroes coming together in the culminating battle against Thanos. So much anticipation, ticketing app crashes, and going through so much to try to see this on opening night. Now here we are. Does Avengers: Endgame live up to its high expectations? Absolutely. I felt like it was unique and carries the most emotional weight off anything in this universe but it absolutely serves its fans who have been loyal for years and years.The film takes place three weeks after the end of Infinity War. Half of the worlds population have been wiped out by Thanos and now the remaining Avengers (who just so happen to consist summarily of the original Avengers) must find a way to not only defeat Thanos, but also avenge the fallen and find a way to counteract the actions that occurred at the end of Infinity War. As expected the film stars a gigantic cast of Hollywood's best and watch out for the cameos from heroes who have appeared previously in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I really would like to talk about this film in a spoiler review but as with every review on my site, there will be no spoilers. I will say that this film has a unique take almost immediately. The humor and banter is still there as it always is and the character arcs are as fantastic as ever at its near completion. The film carries the most emotional weight as anything this universe has seen. The film has so much fan service. I think if you go early on and with a packed crowd of fans you will see just how much this means to the audience who have stayed loyal to this saga.There were laughs, there were cheers, there were gasps, and yes there were tears. The film feels like it should be the very last that the MCU has to offer but of course we know there are Spider-Man and Black Panther sequels coming. The final battle brings just about everything you could hope for. If you're a fan of the series I think you will enjoy this film as it makes a case of being the best Avengers film. It goes hand in hand with Infinity War, of course both films were shot together.Members of the original Avengers put on performances that do their characters the utmost justice after being on this journey for a decade. The film builds up quite slowly but once the plot takes form and the battle lines are drawn it delivers in the way the Russo brothers know how to. Th action is there, and all of what makes the Marvel Universe such a sweeping phenomenon is always there. Some characters could get more screen time, sure. You have to remember that there are so many characters that the film has to juggle and it does that admirably as it is.The film will be a box office hit for sure and will be well reviewed in regards to the Universe as I can already see. I will be seeing this again tomorrow morning and have the same excitement going into a second viewing as I did my first. I found this to be a very special entry and feel like it ties up so much in such a perfect fashion. If you are a fan of superhero fans you need to see this as soon as possible and should do..Whatever it takes.9/10",1
"It's long winded...easily could be half the 3 hours.... Superhero movies are about battles and heroes...not crying and moaning. Watching iron Man wimper off was such a let down. After watching every avenger movie, I am so disappointed. Only 1 good battle, and it's over too quickly. So so so disappointed...I'd take any other avenger movie over this one.",0
"Absolutely loved it, every character gets a good chunk of screen time and they all use it to full effect, its laugh out loud funny at times, really touching at times.",1
"Everyone shines in this movie. Directed to the fans of these 10 last years of Marvel movies. A thank you, beautiful, tragic, fun. The emotion stills my words just after seeing the movie. Have to see it twice again to do it justice.",1
"Definitely not as good as its predecessor but one to be conjured with nevertheless.
The movie starts a bit slower than all MCU movies before it and it takes its precious time to get the action going, but once it does, its all forgiven and forgotten.
Although predictable, because let's face it, where could they go after Infinity Wars? It delivers on all fronts!
There were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and Hawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who found a peaceful way to co-exist.
There were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who actually didn't have to say a single word to get the tears flowing.
They tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all the glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a forgettable performance.
There are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots. Although it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.All considered, a very good movie to end it all, one that you may want to watch it again to take it all in as I will be doing. Well done to all involved and a great big thank you for such a ride that spanned for over 10 years.",1
"Just watch it by yourself. This movie has more deep story, and will mix all your feelings as well. Thanks god nowadays kid has a great role model for them and thanks god that i was born into this era when this Comic Book Movie exist.",1
They are unhappy. Instead of movies bringing joy in their lives they just want their life problems spill over to others. Don't fall for it. This is a good movie.,1
ENDGAME?,1
This movie was really good. I remember my self screaming at the movies sooooo bad along with every other fan! I watched this movie 2 times at the cinema! It was something else! But still something was missing! I don't know what but I gotta say that infinity war was superior! At least for me!,1
My honest unpopular opinion.,1
"I just sleeping in the movie theather, because, okay this is a ""Endgame"", but this movie doesn't have action and i didn't know why this movie don't a sink me.",0
"The sheer scale of Endgame is both its greatest strength and its most significant weakness. On one hand, the film is an epic, three-hour-long spectacle that offers a rollercoaster of emotions-grief, hope, nostalgia, and triumph. The final battle scene, where all the heroes unite against Thanos, is a jaw-dropping, cheer-inducing moment that's destined to be iconic. The visual effects are top-notch, and the action sequences are choreographed with meticulous precision.On the other hand, the movie's scale can make it feel bloated and unwieldy. With so many characters and storylines to juggle, not all of them get the attention they deserve. Some heroes, like Captain Marvel, are underutilized, while others, like Thor, receive arcs that are divisive among fans. Thor's transformation into a depressed, beer-guzzling shadow of his former self is played for laughs but also feels like a disservice to his character development in previous films.The time-travel plot is another area where Endgame falters. While it allows for some fantastic callbacks to earlier films and provides a clever way to undo the events of Infinity War, it also introduces a host of logical inconsistencies. The film's explanation of time travel is murky at best, and the rules seem to change whenever it's convenient for the plot. This lack of clarity can be frustrating, especially for viewers who prefer a more coherent narrative structure.",1
*The Epic Finale*,1
"Wow. This film will have you going through every emotion imaginable.
If you have followed every Marvel movie in sequence leading up to this conclusion, you will soon be left feeling like you have lost a family member. An amazing end to this Marvel chapter.",1
"Emotional, Power and Meaningfully.Remarkable, Memorable.JUST 11/10.Wow Marvel, Thanks for that
Absolutely loved it.#AvengersENDGAME. #MARVEL.What a Movie.",1
"Avengers: Endgame is quite possibly the most hyped up movie of all time. The excitement surrounding this films release is a dream come true for Marvel Studios and Disney. With that being said, I have looked forward to this film since it was called Infinity War Part 2 back in 2015 or so. I really enjoyed my time watching this and it marked the end of an era. I finally realized a couple years ago how much the MCU means to me and how much these characters mean to me that I gladly would accept anything this movie did.The CGI was good, but the green screen showed a little bit (meaning the backgrounds looked fake sometimes), the performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans were great because they treated this movie seriously, the cameos in here felt welcomed and the amount of locations in this movie really make it feel like the Avengers are desperate to go anywhere and do anything to save their fallen friends. With all this being said this is a very well made movie worth your time and money.",1
Comic Books came alive,1
"A must see,
Best movie ever!!!!
I really think this is the best super hero movie ever made!!!
Thank you Marvel",1
time travel? ideal for plot holes!,0
"Excellent, the Best of the Best !
Great 10 years of MCU 🍷",1
Expectations always comes with a slightly disappointment,1
"Avengers: Endgame isn't just a film-it's a cinematic event, a cultural phenomenon, and arguably the most ambitious and emotionally satisfying superhero movie ever made. Over a decade in the making, it serves as the ultimate payoff for years of interconnected storytelling, rewarding both longtime fans and casual viewers with a breathtaking blend of heart, humor, action, and nostalgia. It's more than a sequel-it's a celebration, a farewell, and a victory lap all in one.What truly sets Endgame apart is its emotional depth. While the Marvel Cinematic Universe has always had a strong sense of character, here it reaches new heights. The film gives each of its heroes time to breathe, reflect, and grow. The stakes aren't just global-they're deeply personal. You feel the weight of everything that's come before, the burden of loss, the ache of failure, and the spark of hope that still lingers beneath the surface.The pacing is masterful. Despite its three-hour runtime, there is not a moment wasted. The narrative unfolds with precision, shifting effortlessly between intimate character moments and large-scale action set pieces. The story is bold and unpredictable, taking risks that most blockbusters wouldn't dare to try. Yet it never loses sight of its heart-and that heart beats strong in every scene.Visually, Endgame is stunning. From its sweeping cosmic landscapes to its gritty, grounded battles, the film is a visual feast. The CGI is flawless, and the cinematography enhances every moment with grandeur and gravitas. The action sequences are choreographed to perfection-intense, thrilling, and emotionally charged. But it's not just about explosions and spectacle. The film's quieter moments are just as impactful, with dialogue and expressions that hit harder than any punch.The cast delivers some of their finest performances to date. Every actor brings their A-game, fully embracing the weight of their character arcs. The chemistry between the ensemble is undeniable, and watching them interact, clash, and unite is a joy. The film is packed with callbacks, inside jokes, and Easter eggs, yet it never feels overstuffed or self-indulgent. Instead, it feels like a reward for those who've taken the journey since the very beginning.The score by Alan Silvestri is another standout, soaring in the epic moments and softening during the emotional ones. Music has always been a key component of Marvel's identity, and here it elevates the film to another level. The themes are unforgettable, enhancing both tension and triumph with every note.What makes Avengers: Endgame so special isn't just its scale, its characters, or its stunning visuals-it's its soul. This is a film made with love and respect for its universe and its fans. It ties up threads that have spanned more than 20 films and offers closure in ways that are powerful, heartfelt, and unforgettable. It's rare to see a franchise end on such a high note, but Endgame manages it with grace, grandeur, and an overwhelming sense of purpose.There's something truly magical about seeing all the pieces come together-every character, every storyline, every emotional beat building toward a conclusion that feels both massive and intimate. It's a film about legacy, about sacrifice, about rising when everything seems lost. It's about finding strength in unity, and courage in the face of impossible odds.Avengers: Endgame isn't just the best Marvel film-it's one of the best blockbusters ever made. It sets a new standard for superhero storytelling and redefines what a shared universe can achieve. It's a love letter to its audience, a heartfelt goodbye to beloved heroes, and a thunderous, emotional, jaw-dropping finale that will be talked about for years to come.Whether you're a die-hard fan or someone just discovering the magic of Marvel, Endgame will move you. It will excite you. And most importantly, it will stay with you long after the credits roll. A true masterpiece-and one that reminds us all why we fell in love with these heroes in the first place.",1
A fun ride that doesn't live up to the hype but is worth watching all the same,1
"Too many plot holes, but good enough nonetheless!",1
Flawed but amazing conclusion to the Infinity storyline,1
What Makes the Emoji Movie so Bad?,0
"Saw 'The Emoji Movie' as a big fan of animation, to see whether the concept (which was one that was hard to decide whether it was intriguing or baffling) would work, as someone who has liked the previous work of a lot of the voice actors (i.e. Patrick Stewart) and whether it was as bad as the tsunami of negative publicity before release and when it came out made it out to be.After seeing it, there are worse films out there (animated and otherwise) but 'The Emoji Movie' is a mess, if not quite the recipe/incarnate for cancer that has been described. Regarding the target audience from personal experience (this doesn't mean that it will apply to all audiences or everybody's experiences), 'The Emoji Movie' didn't appeal to either children or adults in my cinema screening. Adults were squirming their way throughout the film and while recognising the things that are referenced were groaning and rolling their eyes at how everything was executed. Children looked like a lot of the ideas were going over their heads and seemed more interested in their bags of sweets and popcorn than what was going on on screen. It was a mix of both with me.The best, or shall we say the least bad, thing about 'The Emoji Movie' is the voice cast. Most of the voice actors gave decent performances (James Corden and Patrick Stewart are the liveliest of the bunch), though a few didn't fit their characters (Maya Rudolph has shown that she can voice act with a lot of bubbly personality but she was just wrong here). They did deserve much better however, and should have known much better, didn't think that Stewart could lose more dignity but he managed it in a embarrassingly misconceived character that he gave much more to than deserved.Everything else comes off badly or worse. There are worse-looking animated films, but the animation never rises above routine, often looking flat and stiff and there is a complete lack of imagination, the colours never popping out at you as they ought like they do from personal experience with ""emojis"". The soundtrack is all noise and no subtlety, and tends to be inappropriate.When it comes to the writing and the story, 'The Emoji Movie' fails. And not just by a little. We are talking hardcore. All the jokes fall flat because of how randomly they tend to be executed and the jokes in quality are juvenile at best and infantile at worst. The script is peppered with dialogue that is overripe and will embarrass even the youngest of cinema goers, when it's not going over their heads. The story, proof that the concept was more of a questionable one than a good one, is not much of one and feels like it was made up as it went along, with the insertion of the likes of Candy Crush, Spotify, Youtube and Facebook being little more than blatant product plugs explored in a mostly throwaway fashion. There are a lot of random and unnecessary scenes and even more so facepalm-worthy moments.Imagination is zero here, with a mishmash of ideas reminiscent of 'Inside Out', 'Wreck It Ralph' and 'The Lego Movie', all three actually being good films (masterpieces in the case of the first two), but without the fun, creativity or emotional investment which are as non-existent as the imagination. The basic theme is a relatable one when done right, but dealt with indifferently. The characters are both bland and annoying, character development is minimal and what there is is rushed.Overall, a mess. While it is a little better than made out, there is the agreement that the film is a disaster that is more poop than it is meh, despite being the general consensus it seems that this review is not going to be popular when it comes to useful votes. Despite being a subjective person, the excessive non-useful votes for the negative reviews and the up-voting of the positive ones are a little suspicious to me. 2/10 Bethany Cox",0
"'The Emoji Movie"" is a new children's film. One of the posters for it has a picture of whipped poop on the front of it. Was there a focus group done that says kids really want this?This masterpiece takes place inside of some kid's i-phone in a place called Textopolis. Gene is a Meh emoji who just wants to cut loose and show a whole range of emotions, which apparently counts as a malfunction and gets him scheduled for deletion.Now before you think i'm just going to crap on this movie, know that it is kind of fun for a certain age.These killer robots chase Gene and two of his buddies around which always keeps things fast-paced, there's all sorts of promotional tie-ins with Candy Crush, Instagram, and Spotify that while cheap product placement, also are kinda funny and exciting.Like all kids movies nowadays with fairly weak scripts, there's also a soundtrack filled with dance songs that should have kids dancing in the aisles, and guess what, it's not just stuff from your kids generation but some from yours too.Take the stuff that's for you where you can cause a lot of the jokes are either literal bores (Internet trolls are trolls, etc.) or center a lot on cartoons having overly cartoony personalities. There's an overly smiley emoji who borders on the psychotic, joyless Meh emojis. This stuff is kinda funny, but the joke is thin.Then there's the stuff you should expect already going in. Like the jokes centered on the poop emoji, or the Hi-Five emoji saying ""talk to the hand."" Does anyone say this anymore? It's amazing this movie was co-written by Mike White, writer of ""School of Rock"" and Jennifer Aniston's ""The Good Girl"".It's sporadically funny and you can tell it's trying be a kind of ""Wreck It-Ralph"" meets ""Inside Out"" but it's not really inventive enough to be either.The kid whose phone this is never really becomes much of a character and probably the funniest part of this movie is that among a plethora of other scattered and unsubtle messages about including everyone and real friends are better than online ones, this also comes with a message of ""be yourself"" told primarily through emojis who want to be more than themselves.Lastly, and for the love of God I hope this was meant as a joke, there are scenes where the emoji is given way too much credit in the scope of love and life in this film. If this is true then it really does go all the way down from here folks.But that's ""The Emoji Movie"" in a nutshell. You'll laugh in parts, wanna reach over and tell your kids movies used to be so much better than this in others, and finally, just want to weep for the future.If you liked this, please check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.",0
"I hate this movie so much! It wasted such perfectly good voice actors, and it was a waste of product placement! Man, it ripped off Wreck-it Ralph, The Lego Movie, and Inside Out! The jokes are just stupid! Sure, the animation was fine and all, but still!",0
"The plot is not exactly stellar, however the performances are good and the jokes are funny and smart.
It is relevant to the present, even though not exaclty easy to relate to the characters.
The message of the movie is also a nice one, inspirational and motivational.
In any case the movie does not have any serious flaws rhat would make it a 3.3 stars movie, it hds the storyline together and coherent, as said it is smart and funny.
If you came across on this movie on TV do not chnage the chanel, it is worth the watch.",1
"Don't watch it, you'll waste your life!!! Watch Spider-verse instead!!!",0
"This film rips off Wreck It Ralph, Inside Out, and The Lego Movie. The story was boring, the jokes were unfunny, HI-5 was more annoying and obnoxious than funny, and it portrays teens as phone addicts who can't go 5 seconds without their phones, even in class. While I may also be a teen who spends a lot of her time online, I get off when I need to. The animation is good, but good animation cannot save a bad film from being bad.""Oh, but Galán, you're just not part of the film's target audience!""I know that, but I'm also not part of the target audience for the films it rips off (Well I was when they came out) and I still enjoy them. Sony cancelled the Popeye movie for this, and the Popeye movie looked like it had more effort put into it, it looked more promising. I luckily didn't have to pay to see it, but to the fellows who rated 1 star and had to pay, I'm sorry.So the only things I liked were the animation, and that the teens looked like actual teens rather than twenty-something year olds (while they cast adults to play teens in live-action teen movies, I've seen some animation where the teens still look like adults).",0
The WORST Movie of 2017 and an IMPRESSIVE Worst Picture from the Razzies!,0
"I doubt anyone expected this movie to be Citizen Kane but I have to say it at least didn't put me to sleep. Unlike Citizen Kane.The premise of creating a film around emojis is extremely thin, however the result is suprisingly fun with some very good casting choices, such as Tim Miller. The moral of the story is a bit of a miss but I doubt this was the reason most people saw this.It also goes to show that Patrick Stewart is up for a laugh by allowing himself to be cast as the poop emoji, by far the most unique role he's ever taken on.Overall it's great mindless fun for people of all ages and well worth at least one viewing.",1
"This is pure art. I don't need words for context. You can just tell by the beautiful and meaningful title, depicting the innocent and dream-like lives of the Emojis! 10/10",0
"I am not paid by sony or the producers so this is a real review:
the movie had a good story (like every other movie) the animation was pretty good and the jokes were pretty funny 10/10",1
"So bad, I can't even find words to describe it... Why????? Funny? Nope. Exciting? Nope? Did we learn something? Yeah, never ever watch The Emoji Movie again! And Hollywood has too much money... And NEVER EVER watch this crap again!",0
It's hard to overstate how bad this is. A stellar comedic cast and any one of them could have created a better movie if it was just 90 minutes of them reading the phone book.Do not ever watch this!,0
"I didn't like the film that much, but...product placement? Really?",0
"Just awful. The jokes didn't land, the animation was dull and uninspired, the characters, when they weren't being incredibly annoying, were one note and clichè. Really, who on earth had the idea to make a movie about emoji? Not only all this, but the film is so much a copy of other kid's films it's not even funny. Half the time I wasn't sure if I wasn't the Emoji Movie, or Wreck-it-Ralph (A far superior film) Don't waste your time on this. The fact that a Popeye movie was canceled for this after the incredible footage released is criminal.",0
"I'm shocked this is rated so poorly. The movie was enjoyable and fun, and great for kids. Was this a dramatic masterpiece sure to win awards? No. Of course not. it was not intended to be that sort of movie. It is the story of a broken emoji's quest to become un-broken. He must journey through different apps on the phone in order to reach the cloud. On this journey we get to see an imaginative view of what different apps could look like if the were ""real"". It is pretty clever, really. The Emoji Movie is full of humor (the joke about the elderly is HILARIOUS) and it has Steven Wright voicing the main character's father. I think this movie is definitely worth watching if you have kids... They'll love it and I would think the parents would enjoy it too.",1
This movie should be considered a crime against humanity,0
"We live in a society 💔😭
Also the main character, Gene, is hot.",1
Not as bad as I feared,1
Its dump,0
"Here we go.... The Emoji Movie: basically smash The Lego Movie and Wreck-It Ralph together and get a sentient aubergine to write it and you get the Emoji Movie- which is about Gene (T. J. Miller) a 'Meh' emoji, but Gene has other emotions beyond just meh and is labelled a malfunction so he sets of on a journey through the phone to find himself, while also going through Candy Crush, Just Dance, YouTube, Spotify, Dropbox, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter... USE OUR PRODUCTS.This is a bad movie straight up, but I kinda of wish it was worse. Then it could have turned into 'so bad it's good' kinda film, but sadly this is just a dull, zestless, pointless and oddly confusing movie which is only 1 hour and 31 minutes long but feels like 3 hours staring at a flickering light bulb with this stupid gormless smile. Patrick Stewart voices a poo emoji- do you want a more telling metaphor than that?The thing is for a movie about our emoji culture, it seems to hate its very subject matter, it makes fun of all its app related features but never goes full out on them so it's not even a satire of this culture.And of course the product placement is just the worse. There's literally a 10 minute sequence in the Candy Crush world where they play an actual game of Candy Crush. That said the beat moment in this ""movie"" was the Instagram part: the characters could walk into the photo itself and everything is frozen in place which is kinda nice but I've seen that done better in other movies- Looney Tunes: Back in Action did that with actual works of art, with the style of animation mirroring the style of art which is way more creative.Unsurprisingly this is a bad movie but no where near enough that it's worth any great deal of attention. If you want to see an alright animated movie anytime soon go see Cars 3 it's another Cars movie but that's more entertaining than this 'meh' movie. I give The Emoji Movie a D-.... But this was also my worst cinema going experience to date- never has the audience reflected the movie so well (they also were just the worst) and for that The Emoji Movie gets demoted to an F",0
A roller coaster of emotions,0
"Gene couldn't be meh, but this ""movie"" made me meh. Turned it off after 15 or 20 minutes and I was watching it for free. One of the worst things recorded to film I've ever had the displeasure of letting come into contact with my cornea.",0
"This is this kind of movie that you think you would love it but when you watch it you realize that its total disaster. This movie doesn't have any story. I expected that this movie will show that having friends and connecting with people in the real world it is more important than texting emojis on your telephone.
In my opinion, this is the worst movie I ever saw.",0
"You look at this title page and think, Oh, what a cute movie about emojis! You watch the film and think, I want my life back! This movie contains a ridiculous plot that sounds like the creators are just trying to sell about 100000000 emoji pillows. The plot isn't even that clear, and it's hard to understand why anyone's doing anything in the first place. The interactions between characters are weird and unnatural.But let's start from the obvious. This film contained two game tutorials and three demonstrations. You can practically see a little four year old thinking about how great Dropbox is as they watch this excuse for a motion picture.You would assume a movie to be enjoyable, artistic, original, and funny. The Emoji Movie is none of these things. Absolutely unoriginal - a typical story about someone who doesn't fit in. None of the jokes in this entire movie even made me smile. It is an insult to the arts. When you put all that I have said together, you can assume that it was not enjoyable either.I beg you not to pay to have one hour and thirty-one minutes of your life wasted.",0
"I just want to start this by saying I went into this with zero expectations because of all the reviews. I was amazed when I watched it I found myself genuinely loving it. I thought it was a very fun kids movie. I think people sometimes dislike things because they think it is ""cool"" but one thing I was taught from a very young age was to not be too cool to enjoy things. I know it sounds cheesy but I swear some people just dislike because ""everyone"" else dislikes it too. I am not saying that you have to like or that's the reason why everyone say they dislike I'm just saying try not to be negative. It's a great movie that is nothing more than it needs to be. It does have some bad parts like a bit too much consumerism but it is so feel good. This is just my personal opinion but think twice before you decide the movie is going to bad.",1
"I feel like this movie had a good message for kids and well, everyone. I don't understand why it was so hated. My family and I were really hoping for a sequel. I think people need to give this another chance.",1
Not much else to say. Nothing is good about this movie. I guess the animation was good kinda sad the animators tried.,0
"The Emoji Movie...okay, I just made a bit of pause because I don't even know how to start this. Let me just start how I usually start. The premise. So in this boy's phone, there's a city called Textopolis where all emojis live (?) and wait to be picked by that boy. And we follow the emoji that has multiple emotions and he's supposed to be ""meh"". So he wants to kinda cure himself on this journey through all kinds of product placements possible.At the same time that boy Alex who owns the phone tries to make her like him with an emoji because I guess emojis and technology are the only way to express your feelings this days, and there's even a quote in this movie about how emojis is the most important form of human communication. I'm not lying, I'm not exaggerating, they said that. It's freaking line from this movie. If you still don't believe me, I don't blame you, just don't try to make sure while seeing it for yourself. You DO NOT need that in your life. You have better things to do with your time. Just imagine something like The Lego Movie, Tron and Inside Out if all of them were one giant cash-grab of a ""movie"". Halfway through, I couldn't even tell if I was watching a movie or a feature-length commercial. With every cliché an animated kids movie could possibly fall into. Lead isn't who everyone wants him to be? Check. ""Funny"" sidekick on a journey? Check. Group arguing before the third act starts? Check. A character supposedly dies? Check. A dance sequence to a pop song (possibly by Pitbull)? Check. Only this one isn't even relevant anymore. Wanna know what it is? Well, even if you don't, I just can't resist. It's FEEL THIS MOMENT? GET IT?! BECAUSE THEY ARE EMOJIS AND THEY FEEL THINGS?! Ha, ain't that clever?!Okay, I don't think I have anything else to say and even if I do, it's probably nothing good. Avoid this and maybe you'll save the movie industry at least a little bit.",0
It is hard to believe that this movie really exists in our time right now,0
"This movie has 1,5 stars because some rewievers find it funny to give this wreck 10 stars. it don't even deserve that much. i knew it would be horrible. it's a movie about emoji's. nothing good can come out from such a bad idea. but it was actually worse than i expected. usually i can laugh about atleast something or find some jokes clever. this movie had none of those moments. and the ""vague"" hints of a femenist message really didn't help. who's brilliant idea was it that the female character should say ""You know, women are always coming up with stuff, that men are taking credit for"" when she didn't even say it. sure it was implied that was her idea but it's so stupid to make it about men taking womens ideas. and it was even more obvious what the movie wanted you to think when yet again the female character says later in the movie ""im not going to be a princess waiting for my prince charming"" overall a horrible movie with alot stolen from other movies and what's originat is unfunny and bad. don't watch it",0
The movie's message is that communication among people is failing and can only be saved by texting with more emojis.How about face to face conversations?,0
"The movie starts off with a horrible intro. The whole is just a cliche, and the plot is what you expect, an emoji goes around a lot of apps we use, and they use ""subtle"" hints to women's rights. There's a fine line between a child's movie, and a fake PG movie. This movie crosses it, many time over.",0
"Hello there! I took my three grandchildren to the cinema the other day to see the Emojee Movie, and my kids LOVED IT! They said ""this is bound to be a meme"" which is a silly word meaning ""the greatest"". My youngest daughter got frightened by the scary viruses, reminiscent of the ones on my Windows Vista. But my other kids ATE IT UP! Very funny plot about the cell phone, also, i love candy crush! They said the day after that Jacksfilms is the movie's biggest fan! But I am reigning supreme!Sincerely,
Donna W, Emogee Movie connoisseur",1
"Not as good as Toy story and Wreck it Ralph, but still underrated as far as I'm concerned",1
Worst animated movie ever!,0
"At one point in the movie they were facing the firewall. It was a pit bull song where it says ""Im a fireball"" when it clearly should've been 'Im a firewall'.Overall the movie was 'meh'.",0
"This film is more than a film. It's art. Out of the many outstanding qualities the themes are the most impressive. It serves as a reflection on our own society, the breaking of norms and the oppressive Orwellian government pushing what's different down. True authenticity is a rarity in our culture, with the transcendent message of the film and the innovative concept and animation. The way this film was done has never been done before. Ever. There is literally nothing like it. Focusing instead on making a masterpiece rather than making money, instead of being an half assed ad like Anomalisa. The Emoji restores my faith in film and in turn restores my faith in humanity. Definitely deserves it's own cinematic universe. 10 out of 10.",0
"When I first settled down to watch The Emoji Movie, I really didn't think I would enjoy it at all. I just watched it to have a few laughs, at the jokes, and maybe how bad it was; but it's actually pretty damn good.Gene is an emoji that makes more than one expression; a problem, considering he's supposed to be meh. After messing up and having the wrong face when he's scanned, Gene sets out on a mission to become a real emoji, and to only be meh.I personally think that this is a gem of a movie. Of course, it's much less for adults, and any one that's rather anti technology, but this has some serious life lessons in it:1) Friendship is important2) Don't bend to society's rules3) Being you is the best you you can beThere was nothing I really took from it, of course, as I knew these already, but considering this film is aimed at the technology age of children, this is an absolutely brilliant movie to take your kids to see. Maybe you won't enjoy it, but they definitely will, and it will teach them things along the way.Not as good as other movies, such as Inside Out, but this is a gem, and it really does have a lot to it, rather than being an annoying movie marketed on a trend.",1
This movie is an hour and a half long advertisement. There was no reason or idea behind this movie but rather they needed an excuse to just shamelessly plug things.,0
Before seeing this film I had had only 2 girlfriends but now that I can converse about the fine arts I have 28. 10/10 would recommend,1
"I saw this movie to see how bad it was and it was a terrible, terrible mistake. This movie is basically what would happen if you put Inside Out, Wreck it Ralph, crap, garbage, and an iPhone in a blender, then put it it in the oven, took out the result, nuke it, then put the ashes back in the oven, and the emoji movie comes out. Do not watch this movie! Ever!",0
Don't watch,0
"This movie was a mistake in all senses of the word. The animation was pretty good, I'll give it that, but the writing and quality control of the voice acting and screenplay was abysmal. The only benefit to this movie was the reaction of the internet.Sony Pictures Animation has fallen so, very, far.",0
Trash. That's what this movie is. Don't even bother watching. Save yourself.,0
"This movie is god awful, i don't understand why 6 people rated the movie 10/10 in a row in the 'user reviews', maybe these accounts were created to bump up the ratings of this awful movie, besides, what movie is entertaining with James Cordon in the cast?",0
"My kids are making me watch this deck on Netfrix as I type this. If the Lord is ready to receive me into His kingdom, I am definitely ready to go.",0
"emoji - ""meh""",1
"People, DO NOT listen to the people that gave this film 10/10. It might be obvious that those guys must be paid by Sony to rate this. So try managing your review setting so you can avoid them. But if you want to... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!",0
Regardless of low rating....it's a very good cartoon with an interesting story and satisfying conclusion,1
"The Emoji Movie is about the Meh emoji Gene, played by talented actor T.J. Miller. It has everything you'd want out of a movie, conflict, good characters, engaging story and a happy ending. Without spoiling this masterpiece I can tell you that Gene goes through an epic adventure where he grows as an Emoji. I don't have any kids because I hate them, but the kids in the theater seemed to enjoy themselves, even after I ""accidentally"" spilled my soda on them, hahaha. It is definitely worth a watch, if you ask me.-Ya boi Tony",1
THEY CANCELLED POPEYE FOR THIS?!?!?!?!,0
"Stereotypical, Confusing, and Just Plain Awful....",0
Bringin back 2010 in an absolute catastrophy of a movie,0
"There are only 5% of the reviews are positive. Do not believe them. There is a reason this movie sucks, I may not be explaining it right here but read the other reviews here!",0
"I got so bored while watching it that while it was still playing i made this IMDb account just to rate it 1 star. This movie is the reason why IMDb needs to add a 0 star rating.
There has been an experiment in which a person is shocked when he touches a button, says that he's never going to touch it, then he gets put in a room with the button and they get so bored that they touch the button multiple times just because they have nothing better to do.
Now, if they repeat this experiment but this time they replace the electric shock and the button with the Emoji Movie, it's going to bring in media attention and lawsuits because it's unethical to lock up a person in the same room as this horrendous movie.",0
"I've never seen such an unrelevant movie before. It's just so dumb and nonsensical, it is like a bad mix of the Lego movie and Pixels. Just do not watch it.",0
OK I went in expecting the absolute worst from this movie as I was purchasing my ticket however as I got sat down I began to reolise all my worries were for nothing I really liked the movie it kept me entertained I don't know what the hell most of America saw but I laughed out loud more than once and my fave emoji was the badass jailbreak I say take the family go by yourself just ignore the critics and see this movie,1
"The idea of this was great, but by making it the way they did, I will never look at an emoji the same way.In this film, we are treated as if we are brainless drones. Did the makers assume we would not notice that The Emoji Movie is one giant advertisement? Because that is all this movie is. Two tutorials on how to play games, and many demonstrations of how great phone's apps are. I wasted an hour and thirty-one minutes on my life watching this, when I would much rather have been sitting bored at home.The plot was messy and stupid, containing one pathetic joke after the next. The trailer was more entertaining. I will not be surprised if next year, a fidget spinner movie is released.This is also offensive to high-school aged students, as the beginning literally states that as a high-school student, Alex's entire life revolves around his phone. Another thing about that is that all they do 24/7 is text, and all they seem to use are emojis. Are the script-writers saying that all a high-school student does throughout the course of their day is press little icons on his phone to send to others?Why did people fight over creating this monstrosity? People in the year 3017 are going to look back on July 18, 2017 as the year humanity was at its lowest pitfall. Historians will marvel at how a movie that sucked so much managed to sell even one ticket after opening night.I want my life back.",0
Very good yes i like the part where he does the thing,1
Don't believe all the horrible reviews,1
"I went into this movie expecting it to be rubbish, but I certainly wasn't expecting the astoundingly high amount of blatant racism and homophobia in it, especially during the first and third act. I specifically recall the scene where after praising Elliot Rodger as a hero, Gene and Jailbreak tell all LGBT members in the film that they didn't deserve love, then proceed to have a massive orgy with the rest of the characters, which was extremely disturbing and totally inappropriate for children. I can't believe Sony allowed Tony Leondis to get away with this appalling piece of ""cinema"".",0
Just a terrible movie who makes money off cool and hip emojis.,0
I would rather break all my Jones in my boy than watch this horror movie i hate it,0
Probably one of the worst movies to ever exist. Please do not waste your money on watching this movie. It's is not worth your time.,0
"This movie is pure trash. It's just so sad that a bunch of people came in and thought this was a good idea. The whole movie is one big ad,
and it's literally trying to make a full on scene just by making ads. I can't believe someone just sat there and thought ""No ones gonna notice the ads!"" I just feel really bad for all the people who had to suffer watching this movie, I'm just... so sad.Humanity is doomed.Really, humanity is gonna get nowhere with this kind of ""Movie"" (Seriously, how can you even consider this a movie and not just one fat ad?!?)Also, The Emoji Movie's storyboard feels like it was written for 3 minutes until they pitched the idea. Just one fat try to make money by advertising companies in an awful ""Movie""If you ask me, the poop emoji should've been the main character because he represents this ""Movie"" amazingly.1/10 - At least I can laugh at all the jokes they make off this ""Movie""",0
This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.,0
Nowhere near as bad as the reviews would suggest,1
"This movie is easily the worst of all timeI mean I would rather watch The Room than watch thisSeriously it's awfulDon't, and I mean itDON't WATCH THIS MOVIEI wish I could give it lower than a one",0
Perfect story telling where you use no original ideas or settings or characters or lines or jokes. So you don't have to use the two Brain cells you have!,1
This movie if great for kids. I enjoy watching it too. The only thing that sort of bothered me is the underlying message. It has a little of the PC feel but doesn't push it too hard. You know the everybody's trying to stay in their expected social cues and anyone that breaks from the patriarch will be hunted down and killed! That PC. But your kids will love it and shouldn't read between the lines. I ask you not to either. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. Dumb fun with some really cool moments and understanding of what really happens when we press the little emoji button on our phones.,1
"If you would like to watch an hour and a half long commercial then this is the movie for you. The entire film revolves around these brand deals they were able to acquire such as Candy Crush, Just Dance, and Spotify. Even if it doesn't make sense for the plot and what is happening for these brand deals to be brought in to the movie, they are still included. It's like watching a YouTube video with mid roll ads that interrupt the video.
The plot itself is very common and not nearly as different or interesting enough as many other films with this format. The characters are bland and forgettable since they are literally the same characters as your regular outcast hero characters. If you want to see a good version of this film, watch Wreck It Ralph. While that film isn't the exact same as this, it is quite similar and much more intriguing and interesting. I can't even think of a single thing I liked about this film, that's just how bad it was.",0
"As you probably know, this movie is notorious for being absolute garbage in every aspect except for the animation, which is literally the only decent thing about this movie. Now, I had been wanting to see this movie for a while now. Not because I actually thought I'd enjoy any of it, but because I wanted to see just how garbage it is for myself. So I turned on the TV, went to Netflix, and put on The Emoji Movie.And oh BOY does it live up to the level of garbage that everyone says it is.
I can't even say much about the entirety of the movie, because I got literally 14 minutes into the movie and already regretted my decision to watch it. It's so unfunny and the ""plot"" (I use that loosely) just doesn't make sense. Also, it has SO MUCH PRODUCT PLACEMENT, including TWO GAME TUTORIALS. IT'S JUST SO BAD. So, 14 minutes in and I said, ""No. I don't want to sit through this anymore. I can't."", and promptly stopped the movie. It's utter garbage in pretty much every aspect. Please don't waste any of your life watching this cesspool of garbage, you won't enjoy it and the only entertainment you could get out of it is ironic stuff that wasn't meant to be funny in the way it is, and even then it'll only give you a small chuckle. You know, here's a list of movies that your time would be better spent on:
Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse
Shrek
Shrek 2
The majority of Disney/Pixar Films
Avengers: Endgame
Spider-Man: Homecoming
The Princess Bride
You know what, just listen to the reviews. These movies I just listed are amazing, and there are SO MANY MORE MOVIES that you could spend your time on. Just don't spend it on this garbage.",0
I find it strange how most of the 10/10 come from accounts that have only rated this movie.,0
"1 PREDICTABLE STORY LINE
2 BLAND/unlikable CHARACTERS
3 CRINGE-WORTHY JOKESgo watch wreck it Ralph its way better",0
"Pros:
-The movie, as bad as it is, actually looks pretty great. Shoutout to the animation team for at least trying to make this movie have any redeeming qualities.
-There is like, two or three good ideasCons:
-Even without all of the other cons, this movie would've still been a predictable, unoriginal, cliched, boring, and forgettable piece of (poop emoji)
-The writing is INFURIATINGLY awful. I had to pause the movie so many times to let the stupidity sink in.
-The ""jokes"", if you can call them that, are all either bad visual gags or awful ""puns"" that don't even make sense half of the time. There were a few times when I was a little close to laughing, and two times when I genuinely laughed, but the rest of it is garbage.
-This movie has some of the worst product placement I have ever seen. They weren't trying to be even a little subtle, it just felt like I was watching a big ad for a bunch of apps, with an awful movie in between the ads.
-The characters are bad. Gene is just an uninteresting ""meh"" protagonist. High-five is very annoying, and I don't buy his friendship with Gene at all. He just seemed to tag along on the adventure for his own personal gain that I didn't care about. Jailbreak is a somewhat boring character who randomly spouts out feminist remarks from time to time, and does some EXTREMELY out of character things near the end of the movie. Again, I don't buy her relationship with Gene, but at least it isn't the most forced in relationship I've ever seen.
-This movie doesn't seem to have rules. Here are some examples (minor spoilers):
""He is going to go to the phone store to delete us tomorrow!"" After what seems like a few minutes in the movie's time: ""We only have 4 hours before the phone is deleted!""
""We have to travel to the other side of the phone to get to the trash to save High Five from being deleted!"" Later: ""Here, I can pull up this email you found and left in the trash on my screen.""
Not to mention, a large amount of things that happen in the movie are just not how phones work at all. Also, many plot holes and things that didn't make sense were created just to throw in more ads.
-There were some subplots, but I din't care at all about them. At least they were breaks from the infuriating main plot
-The voice acting is sub-standardI know there are worse movies out there, but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't watch this ad that is calling itself a movie. It is not so bad it's good, it's just infuriating, and it will be forgotten within a year or two.",0
"Its a different movie from I have watched before. As an expert in animated movies I can tell you, you won't regret it.",1
Watched this with a bus full of 8 year olds. Thank you God for the experience of a lifetime and have a good day.,0
It's horrible dont watch it. The only good thing about it is that it's consitant. Consistantly bad.,1
"""The Emoji Movie"" is notorious for being awful. And, considering I love to occasionally watch an awful film in order to get a good laugh, I decided to finally see this piece of dreck. Overall, it was a terrible movie but perhaps not as terrible as I expected. It ended up being more tedious than painful to watch.So what's wrong with this movie? The writing. Despite the film being all about emojis, the writers managed to hit every possible cliche a kids movie could use. And, considering these are emojis, it just didn't make sense to stick so close to a rather overused formula. Additionally, the film had what seemed like hundreds of jokes relating to computers and social media....and each and every one of them fell flat. And, several of these 'jokes' involved the poop emoji. This is because in none of these was there even a hint of humor or cleverness.I noticed one review where the reviewer gives this one a 10. That's like saying that a velvet Elvis painting belongs in the Louvre!",0
"Let the truth be told, sony just laid a dump on all of us, poor sound, animation was good but it's lacking a bit.

"Frick you sony. You make me sick. To call this ""video"" a film is honestly insulting to to every movie ever made (yes including The Amazing Bulk.) The obvious pandering is just the start it tries to pull. Blatant advertising of apps, unfunny jokes, and the most basic ""plot"" ever. I hate the emoji movie.",0
Me and 2 other friends went to see this movie and we all agreed that it was cringy but also good at the same time which is the reason why i am giving this movie its deserved rating me and my 2 other friends that saw this movie too i also think that this movie shouldn't have replaced the popeye movie too,1

"When I first read the news that there is an animated full-length feature film being developed called ""The Emoji Movie"", I took my hand and forcefully applied it to my forehead. This movie was absolutely uncalled for, yes, we do live in a generation where everyone has a phone or computer and sends each other instant messages, sometimes adding emoticons to reflect their state, but that doesn't justify the need for it. What made sense to pour out $50 million into making this picture? And how come it ended up making over $250 million at the box office? It's beyond comprehension....""The Emoji Movie"" centers on a city called Textopolis, which is basically in everyone's smartphone, and the residents of Textopolis are various emojis that have a daily job of making faces and emotions whenever the phone user selects one of them in a text message.The main character is Gene Meh, a...""Meh"" emoji that doesn't like to stick to the norm of one single emotion and is targeted for deletion due to his multi-expressions. He bands up with other malfunctioned emojis in order to escape from the software agents that are hunting them and find the Code to fix Gene. The adventure takes them through various apps like Just Dance, Candy Crush or Instagram. The film is literally a marketing gimmick for phone apps.
The fact that Sir Patrick Stewart appears in the film as the Poop emoji had me worried for a bit, but fortunately his appearance is short and minor.The animations aren't half-bad, but that's about the only good part of the movie. All the jokes fall flat, there was not a single moment where I actually laughed.
Judging by the targeted audience of teens and pre-teens, I expected to have more triumph over toys and merchandise, but it didn't really pick up.""The Emoji Movie"" is a film that shouldn't have been made and instead should have invested the budget into something else.",0

"I am genuinely astonished that we live in an age where you could live to see the release of Star Wars, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket,Pink Floyd: The Wall, and Liar Liar and still be in your healthy 40's to see a movie based off of glorified electronic hieroglyphs. The characters are so one dimensional that I only needed to see the extended movie trailer to know the motivations and personalities of each character. There is the main character, going about his life until one day, he messes up his job and needs to climb back up to his position where he could save the day. On the way, he has a love interest with a troubled past, the idiotic sidekick that means well and tries to help the main character but just gets in the way. There is the Den of Deplorables where the scum and the forgotten reside. Then, there is the constant ""threat"" overhanging the world that has the possibility of destroying their community if the character does not hurry up. Then there is an impenetrable obstacle in the way that blocks the character's path of least resistance. Finally, there is the scene where the love interest and main character go through a beautiful scene where they both learn that there is a meaning to life (for example, look at Wall-e.) Finally, the main character gets the girl, solves the problem, and everyone is saved. It is the most carbon copy coming-of-age story imaginable.Don't see this movie. Not even ironically. Do not give these people any money.",0

There is no other way i can describe this level of bad.",0
"I do not recommend watching this movie because it just made me throw the phone out of the window... When I see an Emoji.

What is the next movie going to be? The Snapchat Movie: The rise of the Hotdog filter?Also, this movie is the reason why I've lost the will to live.

"I am being serious. There IS something to them claiming that the US is the devil. The more I read into it the more their cause seems plausible to me. The movie is so stunningly bad it will be the major talking point, in hushed and serious tones akin to talking about a new and unstoppable strain of Ebola, across all known and unknown media. It is an extinction level event all by itself. Someone actually sat down and penned this terminal cancer. I had to sit down through the entire sad affair because it was too horrible not to.

"The Emoji Movie...boy am I embarrassed to have seen this thing. This movie essentially has an A and B plot that work off each other. The A plot is about a 'meh' emoji named Gene who is able to make multiple other expressions. When working at the cube, he messes up terribly by making a face other than a 'meh'. With his new friend Hi-5 and a hacker named Jailbreak, they must find a way to transform him into a 'normal' emoji by journeying through the smartphone. The B plot revolves around a freshman named Alex who tries to get the attention of Addie McCallister by sending her emojis...When I first found out about this movie I thought it was a joke. I just thought it was an April Fools Day prank pulled by Sony, but when the trailer for this movie arose in December, I feared for the worst...I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with the A plot. You may notice that it sounds really familiar, and it does. It sounds like the plot of Wreck-It Ralph. Just from the second trailer I knew that we would get a Wreck-It Ralph vibe. That's essentially what the concept of the A plot is. It's like they took the concept of warping from world to world presented in that movie and put it in a smartphone. The movie doesn't even go in-depth into what Gene's condition is. It just tells you that Gene can express multiple emotions and expect you to roll with it. All that does is bring analytic viewers to question the ideas of the movie. When it comes to the A plot though, it's just linear, predictable and unpleasant to sit through.Hi-5 is a pointless character. All he does is act as the comic relief, and he even fails at that, as he didn't make me laugh once throughout the picture. The jokes in this movie are all cringeworthy. None of them hit. There were kids in the theater who hardly laughed at all, that's how bad these jokes were. There was only one joke that made me laugh and even that one will eventually become dated.The product placement is incredibly annoying. Throughout the movie we see many different real world apps like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and even Candy Crush. I just felt cheap looking at these and many parts of the movie felt like advertisements for smartphone apps. They even try to be ""cool and hip"" with the kids. There is modern slang usage, movie references and even references to songs that went viral two to three years ago. For example, they play the Nae Nae song by Silento in hopes that kids in the audience can relate. You're not relating to your audience, you're pandering to them. It's not like in Wreck-It Ralph, for instance, where they bring in classic video game icons for viewers to relate to. The difference of bringing these different products in is that the classic video game icons are timeless, while the Nae Nae song became dated.There's also a sub-plot that I won't spoil that feels so pointless, and I say this for two reasons. One, the movie only cuts to that part twice. Second, the characters involved in said plot point don't get anywhere new.As for the B plot, it's probably the best part of this entire film, which isn't saying anything. The characters outside the smartphone are boring, but at least they're not annoying like the emojis. The animation for those scenes looks pretty good for the most part. Even saying that the B plot is the best part isn't saying much. Even the way that plot ends feels predictable.If you are a kid who is really into emojis, chances are that you will enjoy this film. Even at that, I don't think anyone else would enjoy it, just small kids to early teenagers. It's a terrible animated feature that's down there with Norm of the North that's unfunny, linear, empty, full of product placement and is just awful.2/10",0
Not sure why there are so many haters for this film. It's great! And it's funny! I love watching it especially with my kids. Great message!,1
Lol I'm really not sure why this movie is so underrated. I found it interesting maybe not really funny but some jokes were dark and not for kids which was kind of creepy but still the plot is nice. The ending was also really good teaching everyone that you have to be yourself and don't pretend to be someone else. Guilty pleasure. Wasn't masterpiece but far away from bad movie.,1
"Wow. Words cannot describe what I have just seen. It is sad to see that Hollywood as sank this low in creating a film.The worst part wasn't the cliché dialogue or the terrible comedy. It wasn't the predictable and recycled plot. The worst part about this movie is that at one point, a group of executives sat together in a board room and thought, ""What's something hip and cool that kids like?"" and they all collectively agreed that and EMOJI movie would be the best idea.At one point I was in the middle of watching this and I came to the sad realization that I was watching a movie about EMOJIS. Overall, this movie was a sad attempt at trying to keep up with the times, and I hope that this is a Hollywood's final attempt at trying to do something like this.",0
"A Movie adaption about texting, and it's awful",0
"Combine Wreck-It Ralph with Inside Out, then remove everything food about those movies, and you're left with this.It's a movie about emojis, it's as terrible as you think it will be.",0
If I could give this movie a 0 i would! This movie was so boring that I slept in the middle of it and I NEVER sleep through movies! I wasted my $8 on this horrible movie. DON'T WATCH IT!!,0
Soulless movie created solely for the purpose of making money out of a fad. Its not creative in the least and a waste of time. Should have been released straight to netflix and skipped the theaters.,0
"I love animated movies, but this is just a complete disaster. Don't see this movie ever in your life. I watched this movie a while back and I hated every single thing about this movie. First, the jokes aren't that funny. Second, most of the characters were really annoying and bland. This is a complete ripoff of the LEGO MovieThe worst movie by Sony so far.",0
"Not nearly as bad as everyone says. I don't get the hate behind it and I've seen way way way worse. Yes, that alone doesn't make it a good movie, but it's not nearly bad enough to be called ""the worst animated movie of all time""",1
"There was no plot, character development was nonexistent. Product placement was everywhere. The romance was also so amazingly disappointing, and probably shouldn't have even been in the movie. I doubt I will ever have children knowing that they will grow up in a world where this is seen as actual entertainment and not a pile of poop emoji. This isn't a 50 million dollar movie, and looked like it had the budget of your average Bollywood film. I doubt I'll ever see an emoji the same way, as this mentally and emotionally scarred me to the point that I feel emotions have become obsolete. Overall, the movie was an utter waste of money. I give it 2 OK hand emojis out of 5.",0
"I don't understand the hate this movie gets. I found it funny and charming. It's a pretty clever idea, emojis who are only allowed to be one thing. I would recommend people watch it with an open mind before reading the reviews. It's definitely a repeat movie for me, I watch it all the time.",1
"I honestly can't say that I'm surprised AT ALL by the reactions of this movie, because this was met with almost universal disdain from the pitch alone. This is almost like a parody movie that you'd find in a Family Guy cutaway or something, not an actual product that should exist on this planet. Hey, have you seen Inside Out and/or Wreck-it Ralph? Good, you got yourself a double feature that you can watch instead of paying money to go see $50 MILLION get set on fire and watch it burn to ashes for 85 minutes. This movie has only one of very, very few redeeming traits, and it is this: ANYONE can get their movie in theaters, regardless of talent, quality, or entertainment value for ages 2 and under; if you throw enough money at it, you too can play the same weekend as Atomic Blonde with the smug attitude of ""Yes, people (with common sense) will see this.""",0
"I want my $6 back. And all 46,853 ours.",0
THIS MOVIE IS SO TRASH!!!!,0
"The Emoji movie is cancer. That's one word to sum it up. It's very very bad, and can not be redeemed at all. Don't watch if you want to keep your brain cells.",0
Pop Culture Fail,0
"Sony's film studio has manufactured another hit. And that's all you will want after seeing this film. To be hit as many times as possible with a rusty crowbar. The cheapest, sloppiest animation goes nicely with this unfunny unoriginal mess. Don't spend your hard earned money and watch it to see how bad it is. Pirate it if you really want to see how bad it is.",0
"I watched this movie with the lowest possible expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. This movie is boring, hilarious, depressing, and deep, depending on the scene/joke. Watch it with an open mind and prepare to be amazed/changed forever.",1
"Hoping to see any redeeming qualities of this movie's very negative buzz, can't say I was able to when I did. The animation quality, visual setting, and adding a few real-life app names looks inviting on the outside, but upon entering its world and inner workings, it was a waste and abysmal to take seriously as a ""movie."" As though it poorly replicated Pixar's Inside Out concept crossed with the technological theme of Disney's Wreck-It Ralph.I've seen plenty of animated features as both a kid and as an adult, but this is one you'd probably not want to see at a movie theater. It's pretty much a desperate, by-the-numbers cash grab done by all things Sony Animation, who had produced a few SO much better animated titles in the past.In the city of Textopolis, an emoji called Gene (T.J. Miller) is designed to be like his parents (both ""meh"" icons), but for some reason he has multiple ways of expressing himself in the smartphone of young teen Alex that it confuses those around him and his own user. Hoping to find his place, he goes on an adventure with female emoji hacker Jailbreak (Anna Faris) to have a true purpose in his user's data space.Director Tony Leondis said he was greatly inspired by Toy Story's concept, but his approach in using that for emojis doesn't work if the story squanders it with a predictable ending and difficult-to-like, cardboard characters. Other films that used the concept like say, Wreck-It Ralph and The LEGO Movie had a premise and morals that weren't questionable or inane. No. Instead, those movies emitted both the mythos and pathos in an intriguing and creative way. I don't blame the movie's voice cast at all for this mistake, it's the ""story"" that was unoriginal and a hodgepodge, including jokes that were too juvenile to find as funny.Overall, this'll attract the littler ones, but this flick is best suited as direct-to-DVD, not theater worthy.",0
"If your reading this I'm gone now. If ever a movie could make you feel any emotion this is it, never have I wanted to punt a baby panda for a field goal, never have I ever felt that Sony is a sellout when making the movies.......

"In today's world, the phone isn't used quite as the inventors pictured, with actual calling being replaced by texting and snapchat. But one item has been developed to replace the words that are too difficult to write: Emojis. In desperation, Sony has developed a film about these icons in an attempt to break the bank with another hit animated series. Can they succeed, or will this movie be nothing but a bombardment of sad faced emojis? Robbie K here to answer that question for you with another review.LIKES:The Animation: You can say a lot of negative things about the movie, but one plus for this reviewer is the beautiful display Sony's team has designed. Like many movies, the characters move with fluid grace, transitioning through their adventure with little jumpiness. High Five (James Corden) in particular has impressive moves, as having a hand expand beyond simple hand movements can be tricky business. In addition, I enjoyed the visualization of the world within our phone, finding clever design in the development of the internal universes of each app (primarily Instagram's frozen pictures). I'll admit, the characters aren't realistic like Pixar, or even super creative design, but there is cleverness in the world itself.It's Cute: When it comes to cartoons/animated marvels, the pendulum can swing to either side of the age spectrum. Fear not those with little kids, this movie is certainly geared towards the younger side, filled to the brim with color, simplistic jokes, and over the top slapstick that will make many giggle. Sure, there are a few drier jokes that adults will get, but for the most part this movie goes back to basics for family friendliness. One won't have to worry about inappropriate gestures or innuendos in this film.The Morals: Movies are a powerful tool to teach the lessons we humans are too ignorant to learn from mentors, school, and the quickly fading trend of reading. Emoji's movie solid lesson of being yourself and not conforming to the traditional ways is as good rehash of the traditional lesson. Those who stand out from the norm will find great relevance to Gene (T.J. Miller) and Jailbreak's (Anna Faris) quest and most likely grab on to the characters. It's also always good to see a lesson in friendship as well, quoting the movie as ""Better to have one good friend, than a bunch of fake fans followers"". The strong emphasis on this will hopefully break through the persistent firewalls of your subconscious and get you contacting your buddies.DISLIKES:Story: Despite the morals infused into the story, the overall quality of Gene's tale is very basic at best. The Emoji movie has little sustenance to it, diving more into cramming the jokes in the short run time. After all the world building I had hoped for a little more depth to navigating the apps, facing the dangers of the cyber terror that lurk in our phones. I wanted suspense! I wanted exploration of a selection of apps. I wanted an adventure that had a little more depth behind it. I got very little of that. All the obstacles they faced were fairly easy to circumvent, and often not worth mentioning at how lame they were. Certainly, they did a few things right (Just Dance 4), but for the most part, it was a huge loss of potential at decoding the craziness of our obsession with phones.Humor: Humor can be fun when balanced, but unfortunately Emoji movie lacks that balance, once again swinging the pendulum to the younger audience. Most of the jokes are very simple statements that lack any finesse, or decent delivery to maximize the laughs. Much of the humor is dry, and although has adult components, lacks that clever zing that other films/programs do. James Corden rectifies this a little with High Fives self-absorbed personality, but even his banter gets stale after a while. With all of the comedians in this movie, I really had expected more of this movie, but again missed potential.Boring: If you haven't gleamed it from the first two categories, then this should sum this up, Emoji movie is boring. There is no suspense to the adventure, and let's face it no point, to the challenges at hand. I found myself looking at the clock wondering how much longer I had in the ridiculous presentation of smart phone gimmicks. Cute is always great, but it is better left to YouTube and Kid shows that are in short spans of time. Without the jokes to back it up, nor an impressive voice performance, there is just little to scream entertainment outside of watching a child's smile light up at the colorful presentation.The VERDICT:You've seen the reviews of my colleagues, and they aren't far from the truth Emoji movie was a miss for Sony in terms of quality. The lackluster jokes, lack of challenge, and reserved wit were not the right steps to take in this inconsistent adventure for success. In fact, the best thing of this film is the animated short for Hotel Transylvania that precedes it. Still, if you are looking for a safe, family trip to the movies, you've got the Emoji movie to save your bacon. However, I highly recommend reserving this one for Netflix.My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 4.0 Movie Overall: 2.0",0
"Had to redo this review cause I hated that it was disliked so much
This is a poor choice for kids, poor choice for adults, and poor choice for everyone in between. The movie simply has no appeal to -anyone-. I'd hold up Emoji Movie as a shining example that a string a cheap Sega Dreamcast game on the big screen.For children, I can't see the appeal. The handful of jokes in the movie are mostly pop-culture references and poop jokes--most of which will probably sail right over kids' heads--and overly predictable gags throughout. Even then, the jokes that do remain aren't particularly funny: a donut's babies parodying that cereal from ""See Spot Run"" and that's it, or one of the characters quotes a line from Pulp Fiction during what's supposed to be a sad moment.For adults, I definitely don't see the appeal. Besides the trite jokes, the plot is so predictable and irritating that it grates on one's nerves. There is a -bit- of redemption with being able to hear Patrick Stewart and James Cordon's voices, but their lines are so awful that it just begs the question of what possessed them to bother with The Emoji Movie in the first place. Beyond that, the characters themselves are very flat, all of which have stock personalities, and there is absolutely zero development of any of them, not even to reflect the 'moral of the story'.There is no highlight to this movie whatsoever. It's not even worth a Netflix rental. Avoid it altogether and save yourself the 85 minutes. KF.",0
I thought this movie could be atleast a little bit creative but it isn't in the sligthest. I found my self having to use my phone during the whole movie cause I was so bored. Very lousy job of Sony animation studios.,0
Ugh another soulless product placement film with terrible characters and stupid plot don't waste your time with this. These type of films need to be at the bottom of a Walmart bargain bin.,0
"Yep, you read the title, This movie is not worth it, This movie is about an odd-one-out emoji who's supposed to be meh that lives in a phone, (""ORIGINAL"" IDEA) but makes a mistake and stuff, so he teams up with the Carpool Karaoke guy as your worst nightmare and a female emoji who is actually a princess this whole time (WRECK-IT RALPH DID IT FIRST) to make things right, Who wants to play ""Spot the confusing product placement""? Basically, It is just the worst movie ever made in the century, heck, it even made ""Foodfight!"" look like ""The Lion King""! It's a good thing I haven't seen this movie in theaters. But hey, That is just my opinion, So whatever you do, if there is one film, or many films, you need to watch, Please, PLEASE avoid this one. This movie is just one big Sir Patrick Stewart-fest.",0
"The reason this movie is rated so high, is because people joking and rating it 10/10! I know you people hate this movie, but please don't rate it high because it will just make the movie look better then it really is!",0
"The Emoji Movie is completely garbage, useless movie, designed to appeal to young children. It has terrible dialogue, most of the characters are boring and the plot is nonsensical. It is one of, if not the, worst movie I have ever seen. Even though it was such a terrible, god-awful film, I enjoyed it. It's got a certain charm to it that can only be achieved with a perfect storm of awful. Overall the movie fails outright. But just because it is bad, doesn't mean there's no fun to be had.",1
"1970: In 2017 we will have flying cars! 2017: THE EMOJI MOVIE!I can't believe that Sony would create such a horrific film. My eyes are forever scarred. This movie is an atrocity and is just 🅱️ad. WHERE WAS THE 🅱️ emoji!!?? Its unbelievable that people would pay to see a movie like this. I already was starting to believe there was no god, but now I know there isn't. This movie is the opposite of 💯. Don't spend money on this unless you want cancer.",0
The movie business is over now. The emoji movie has made every other movie obsolete. I bet that even Scorsese changed the meaning of 'cinema' films after watching this movie. We have reached the epitome of cinema.The emoji movie is 10/10 true kino.,1
"Oh my gosh this is the worst movie I have ever even heard . All of it was so bloody stupid that I couldn't stop vomiting all over the floor. All the kids in the theater were so mad and ever threw there drinks at the screen!!! In my opinion this is the worst movie ever created!!!!! All jokes in this movie were 100% unfunny and rubbish , none of the characters had any emotion, and it was so boring!!! Both kids and adults with not enjoy!!!",0
"Boy what a piece of 💩! There is absolutely no reason for this movie to exist - none. To make a movie about Legos or Transformers or My Little Pony is one thing, but making an entire movie about the text app on your phone is the equivalent of making a movie called The Secret Life of Smoke Signals. The fact that the movie centers on the ""😕"" emoji is, in a way, kind of ironic. ""😕,"" is quite literally the best thing you can say about this movie. The worst you can say, is it made this reviewer want to 🤢.The (ugh) Emoji Movie follows a few days in the life of Gene Meh (Miller), an Emoji who for some reason doesn't have the ability to do a ""Meh"" on cue. As a result of a first day screw up, Gene becomes a social pariah and risks deletion unless he can find a code that will change his programming for the better...I guess. Along for the ride is former user favorite High-Five (Corden), and the mysterious Hacker named Jailbreak (Farris) who isn't who she says she is but her big, third act reveal means little, and does little other than prop up a cynical Twitter ad.To the surprise of absolutely no one, The Emoji Movie is chalked full of low-hanging fruit when it comes to jokes and basic story elements. But what is surprising is there's so little of anything actually going on. For real though! In between page long exposition dumps, plot contrivance dumps and forced, cringe-worthy youth-oriented vocab dumps, the jokes seem to be spewing at 30% capacity and the plot seems barely alive. It's essentially a movie of surface level dynamics and empty space.What little we have to grab onto in this godforsaken movie is Meh's ambiguously set up heroes journey. A journey that literally takes him, his friends and his family through Facebook, Youtube, Spotify and Dropbox because, you know, what's a movie like this without cat videos, malware updates, bad pop music and ""thumbs up"" stickers. There's also a trek through Candy Crush which not only feels uninspired but does the unthinkable in taking a beat to actually explain the game lest someone in the audience still holds onto their rotary. It all reaches peak stupidity when Meh manages to travel to ""the cloud"" thanks largely to his ability to make faces and remember the name of the girl the phone's user is obsessed with.The final act makes no sense but trust me, by the point Meh makes his return to Textopolis (no joke, the Emojis live in Textopolis), the movie is so far gone, you'll just be glad it's a few minutes from wrapping up. When it finally does wrap up the only question you'll probably be asking yourself is, ""am I angry that I saw this movie, or am I just angry that it wasted my time?"" With a threadbare story and failing significantly to reach already low expectations, The Emoji Movie is arguably the worst movie of the summer. And this is the same summer that brought us the The Mummy (2017) and that's say something! Everything it does has been done before and better, and what it manages to do differently is so cynically implemented and poorly thought out. This isn't a movie, it's a tweet that's grown sentient.",0
The Emoji Movie. It's 💩!,0
"This movie is garbage! Don't watch it.I took my little sibling to see this (I was forced to) and Im very glad with what I saw: a horrible movie. I wanted this movie to fail simply because of how dumb the idea is, and how cringe worthy it is. Right now, it feels like Christmas for me! The movie is so bland and generic, and cheesy, and illogical, seriously they bombed. See Sony, this is karma for screwing over Spider-Man and all relating characters for the past few years. Next time, stick with a Popeye movie.Now, this review Is just my rant about how much I wanted it to fail. But if I were to put a REAL review in, it'd be this: This is one of the most cliché movies of all time. Its like Sony looked at things like Wreck it Ralph and Finding Dory, and just straight up copied it. But made it worse. The characters are bland, the story is bland, and all the comedy fails. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESS.And Patrick Stewart, what are you doing here in this mess? You're better than this, man. Cmon. Poop? Really?",0
"This movie is both boring, and rage inducing at the same time. I, with no exaggeration, almost attempted suicide for the fifth time in the past year. If you have considered seeing this movie ironically, save your money. The movie is so awful that it is generally unpleasant to view even ironically. If you have a history of suicide, I wouldn't risk going to The Emoji Movie as it might trigger an episode. If you're a member of the target demographic for this film and are planning on going to see this movie, re evaluate your life then promptly proceed to donate whatever money you were going to pay for your tickets to charity and take your family out for dinner at a nice restaurant",0

MASTERPIECE,1
"First of all this is a good movie! When i saw the trailer for this the first time, it gave me a warm feeling and it felt like this movie is something special. After it came out in the theaters, it started to get awful reviews saying it's the worst movie of all time. So i starting to second guess my gut reaction from the trailer. I however said NO, i won't believe the movie is that bad, so i went to see it anyway.It's a movie about a Emoji that is not like everyone else but wants to fit in so badly(kind of remind me of The Lego Movie). When he messes up the the chat with the wrong emoji all hell breaks loose. There is a lot of fun moments and uses the actual apps, that many know an love. If you have any know how on the net you know characters like trolls and alike. It even have a great message for us and the kids(unlike Planes...).I can't see how this movie is in the garbage bin, and maybe it's the message of the movie that people lost. Don't be sheeple make up your own mind. I've seen so much worst movies(even though this is a good one) that i fail to see the hate for this. But haters will be haters.",1
"People that are like: ""The Emoji movie is better then Inside out"" are brainwashed, and should stop supporting movies that copy-and-paste original movies like Lego movie.Sony, if your reading this, Please stick to being a video game company.",0
"This ""movie"" (if that's what this horrendous animation was) earned a 3.2 and absolutely deserved it in every way. It made me cringe and waste some perfect money to see this glob of trash. If this movie deserves a 10, then I dive off of a cliff. I would never give this a great review, not even for all the cash in the world.",0
"Yeah, that's about it. The animation looks like some effort went into it. But other than that, it is effectively one of the worst animated movies of all time. Heck, it's one of the worst movies of all time. It will be remembered for how bad it is in future years, so there's that.But 1 year later, Sony produced SpiderMan: Into the Spiderverse. Literally 0-100 in just one year. Damn Sony pictures animation......",0
"I was fortunate enough (and by that I mean unfortunate enough) to see The Emoji Movie before it's official release date. It was awful. I do not recommend this movie AT ALL. Its morals are forced, most of the jokes are terrible, and it's completely cliché. I didn't expect it to be good, and I was right. Don't see this movie.",0
"Saw it on July 28 midnight premiere. In film industry, marketing is notorious, there are times that it works, and sometimes you are hoping to die while seeing the film. The LEGO movie did an amazing job promoting a product but Emojis aren't even a product, there are only faces that actually doesn't have a story, they are only representing emotions, so this could have been the big problem to this movie being a piece of s***. The characters in this movie are stereotyped and don't make any sense for example the main character is the one that is consent of what they are doing and have some moral, then there is a friend of the main character is the typical stupid that doesn't help with anything. The story is the worst, seriously WTF, is an story that we saw a lot of times, the typical things that you use every day have a secret life OMG i never saw that premise (Toy Story, A bugs life, Secret life of pets). But the worst of this film are the jokes, is the wanna be bizarre we saw in LEGO movie but bad executed. Conclussion: Don't give money to this piece of s***, if you want to see it download it by torrent. But even if this movie was free i wouldn't watch it mother of god what a bad experience.",0
"I find it surprising that this movie has such a low rating, if you actually sit down and take it for what it is, it's a great kids movie. It's funny it's bright, it has a message. What more do you want? My 2 year old amd my 13 year old like it.",1
"I saw the movie 5 years ago and it was much better than the reviews. I don't know why people were upset about it. I will excuse them if the movies at that time were very bad and they were waiting for something great or if they were very great and they were disappointed in it, although it is not something you expect a lot for. A good movie for children above 7 Years. I watched it when I was 11 and it was fun for me. A minute ago i saw the trailer and it came out even better than what I expected when I wrote the first letter.",1
"When I first saw the trailer in May, I instantly knew the creation of this garbage was a mistake. Now I know I was correct. The characters are bland, the story is cliché, and the villain is basically like every other cliché villain. The entire movie just felt like a Wreck It Ralph rip off with emojis instead of popular video game characters. The jokes were not funny at all and there was WAY to much toilet humor in this that even a 7 year old kid who likes toilet humor would be annoyed by it. They listed this movie as ""comedy"" even though literally nobody laughed in the theater I was watching it in, not even some kids. Parents, spare your children from wasting 86 minutes of their life and go do something else with that time. This movie deserves to become a box office bomb and is not worth watching.",0
"💩Just by writing this review, I probably spent more time on The Emoji Movie than anyone involved with the script. I'm concerned that by calling this a garbage fire, I'll be doing an injustice to garbage fires. This movie sounded like an inane idea when announced, looked terrible in the trailers, nonetheless surprised me by being worse than I expected. If you can envision a place where creativity goes to die this is it. It represents all the worst elements of Sony as a studio and of Hollywood in general.Remember ""Inside Out"" from a couple of years ago? Did you ever imagine what it would be like if that movie replaced all it's imagination with product placement? That's ""The Emoji Movie"" in a nutshell: ""Inside Out"" sans soul.Our main character, Gene (T.J. Miller),is the son of two ""meh"" emojis (Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge) and he too is meant to be a ""meh"". Sadly,if this movie were ""meh"" it would be a vast improvement. He's not a very good ""meh"" and expresses pretty much every emotion except ""meh"". Because of this, the smiley in charge decides he should be deleted. To escape, he runs off into other phone apps. Remember all the interesting locations the character went through in ""Inside Out"", well here each of those locations is nothing more than a product placement. Gene and Hi-5 (James Corden), who gets caught up in the ""adventure"", go to Let's Dance, Candy Crush, Spotify, YouTube, all in an attempt to get to the cloud aka Dropbox. These side quests exist solely to sell products. Sony outpaces other studios in its use of product placement and cross promotion. Thus, ""The Emoji Movie"" serves as a vehicle for Sony Products and nothing more. Honestly, with all the advertisers featured in this movie it probably paid for itself before one film cell existed.I would say the story is bland and predictable, but in truth it's borderline nonexistent. I wouldn't say it's predictable because that would require an interest in the story's future events when I had none. Literally, I could find nothing to praiseworthy about this movie. Even Patrick Stewart as the Poop emoji never had a chance. What was supposed to pass as humor fell flat. Even when journeying to the separate app, the film's lack of creativity overwhelms everything else. To date, ""The Emoji Movie"" is the frontrunner for worst movie of the year.",0
"""The Emoji Movie"" is Hollywood's next attempt to make anything a ""thing."" The Emoji movie is about a meh emoji who may have a malfunction and some other stuff happens along the way. I don't really know. And I don't really care.The thing with animated movies is that you have to make them appealing to both kids and adults. This was neither. Adults will be bored with it, but at least kids will have fun right? Wrong. When the kid next to me is asleep a half hour into the movie and the girl in front of me leans over to her mother and asks ""Mom is the movie over yet,"" that is a problem within itself.There are so many bad attempts at humor in this film. The ""poop emoji"" is there for the poop jokes and there are other characters that have bad puns. Apparently this is what quailifies as humor now. It wasn't funny. I didn't laugh once throughout the entirety of the runtime.And the second half of this film is just a music video. Song after song plays, you see emojis dancing, and the movie stops taking itself seriously. Not like it ever did in the first place anyways. I just never thought a movie would be dumb enough to make it self a music video again after Suicide Squad did that.This movie loses your interest almost immediately. Movies like this have to be fun, entertaining, and interesting. There were so many scenes in this film where I was drifting off thinking about my next day's activities.This is worse than Transformers 5. Sadly almost as bad as Fifty Shades Darker.I am going to give ""The Emoji Movie"" a fat F, which is equivalent to the Poop emoji.Check out my review here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXA2cj6_bnw&t=1s",0
Oh boy what do i even say...i knew this movie would be like every other movie but my god i didn't think it would be so bad from immature jokes to just plain aggravation this movie is everything bad that it could have possibly been. If you are somebody who likes animation but doesn't care about 1:Story 2:Character 3:Entertaining and pretty much anything else than this movie is for you. Overall this movie is bad and should have never been created.,0
"Wow, just from seeing the trailers of this ""thing"", I instantly want to vomit. IMDb should really allow 0 star and negative star ratings so I can go lower than a 1. Honestly Sony, what were you thinking when choosing this over the Popeye movie? We all knew this film would be a failure, if you look on Rotten Tomatoes you see it has FREAKING 0%! And I also think this is the reason why North Korea wants to nuke all of America, and I don't blame them. This movie made me lose all my faith in humanity. Whatever you do, DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP. You could be doing much better things with your life than paying to go see this pile of crap. And not to mention this is a rip off of Inside Out.",0
